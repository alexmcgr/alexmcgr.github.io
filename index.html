  			It was Election Day, and I felt a special connection as it was the first time I was allowed to vote. I had earned that when I turned 18, which just so happened to be one day prior. My whole family had come over the night before, doing the usual birthday-spiel of cake and presents. The atmosphere was a little different, however, as people weren’t sure whether to be excited or worried for the following day. “He can’t really win, can he?” School during the day of the election had been particularly interesting too, as I had argued with a few classmates on the chances he had of winning. I was sure she would win, and that he wouldn’t have a chance once some ballots came in and started being tabulated. Lots of reputable polls shared my sentiment, and it seemed like I was the only person in any of my classes who had even considered a mathematical approach. I had filled out my mail-in ballot a few days prior, inking the bubble next to her name. 

      </p>
      <p>
      		The first results were trickling in as the MSNBC hosts were detailing each way the night could conceivably play out. “What’s the cover going to be this week if she wins?” I asked my dad. My family started and runs a local newspaper in my hometown of Spokane — called The Inlander — and it has always been fun to get an insider sneak peek at the stories and artwork before they are published and distributed around town. “Not sure, I haven’t seen any of the mock-ups yet,” my dad responded. 

      </p>
      <p>
      		Just hours later, the newspaper was considering running a cover that was completely black that said “MOURNING IN AMERICA.” The night hadn’t gone how any of the anchors had said it would, how any of the polls had predicted, and a brief moment of excitement and hope had been dashed and replaced with fear and worry. 
      </p>
      <p>
      		Four years is a long time, I remember telling myself. He’ll be the President almost the entire time I am in college, and there is nothing I can do about it. I was about halfway done with my University of Washington application, where my dad and my uncle both went to school, where I had been working towards getting into my entire life. Every Saturday in the fall we would catch a Husky football game on TV, my dad remembering his days in school and going to the games and me hoping to one day be able to apply. I still had to finish up my essay to apply, but the election fueled me even more to put everything into the essay. I wanted to go somewhere I could just forget about this night until it was all over.
