    <p>	It was Election Day, and I felt a special connection as it was the first time I was allowed to vote. I had earned that when I turned 18, which just so happened to be one day prior. My whole family had come over the night before, doing the usual birthday-spiel of cake and presents. The atmosphere was a little different, however, as people weren’t sure whether to be excited or worried for the following day. “He can’t really win, can he?” School during the day of the election had been particularly interesting too, as I had argued with a few classmates on the chances he had of winning. I was sure she would win, and that he wouldn’t have a chance once some ballots came in and started being tabulated. Lots of reputable polls shared my sentiment, and it seemed like I was the only person in any of my classes who had even considered a mathematical approach. I had filled out my mail-in ballot a few days prior, inking the bubble next to her name.
